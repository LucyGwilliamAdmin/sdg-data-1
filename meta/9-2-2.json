This indicator conveys the contribution of manufacturing in total employment. It measures the ability of the manufacturing sector to absorb surplus labour forces from agricultural and other traditional sectors towards production labour with higher wages, when monitored over time. However, in developed countries an opposite trend is expected where emphasis has shifted to reduction in labor in manufacturing as part of cost-cutting measures, to promote more capital-intensive industries.","graph_title":"Manufacturing employment as a proportion of total employment","indicator_name":"Manufacturing employment as a proportion of total employment ","published":true,"reporting_status":"complete","data_non_statistical":false,"target":"Promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization and, by 2030, significantly raise industry's share of employment and gross domestic product, in line with national circumstances, and double its share in least developed countries ","target_id":"9.2","title":"Manufacturing employment as a proportion of total employment","un_custodian_agency":"United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO) (with the collaboration of the International Labour Organization \u2013 ILO)","un_designated_tier":"Tier I","data_show_map":false,"source_active_1":true,"source_url_text_1":"http://www.statistics.gov.rw/datasource/labour-force-survey-0","source_active_2":false,"source_url_text_2":"Link to Source","source_active_3":false,"source_url_3":"Link to source","source_active_4":false,"source_url_text_4":"Link to source","source_active_5":false,"source_url_1":"http://www.statistics.gov.rw/datasource/labour-force-survey-0","source_geographical_coverage_1":"Rwanda","source_url_text_5":"Link to source","source_earliest_available_1":"2018","source_periodicity_1":"Quarterly","source_organisation_1":"National Institute of Statistics of Rwanda (NISR)","source_active_6":false,"source_url_text_6":"Labour Force Survey (LFS)","computation_units":"Percentage (%)","national_geographical_coverage":"Rwanda","indicator_sort_order":"09-02-02","national_data_update_url_text":"2019-04-09: see changes on GitHub","national_data_update_url":"https://github.com/sustainabledevelopment-rwanda/sdg-data/commit/e0eb6f76542713c58afbed9f3c6067cfc8129b58","national_metadata_update_url_text":"2019-09-20: see changes on GitHub","national_metadata_update_url":"https://github.com/sustainabledevelopment-rwanda/sdg-data/commit/2b4ac2da55bce32c838c4ccd45126102b8c7e1e9","page_content":""}
