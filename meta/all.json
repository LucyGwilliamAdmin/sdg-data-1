Ambient water quality refers to natural, untreated water in rivers, lakes and groundwaters and represents a combination of natural       influences together with the impacts of all anthropogenic activities. The indicator relies on water quality data derived from in situ   measurements and the analysis of samples collected from surface and groundwaters. Water quality is assessed by means of core physical   and chemical parameters that reflect natural water quality related to climatological and geological factors, together with major         impacts on water quality. The continuous monitoring of all surface and groundwaters is economically unfeasible and not required to       sufficiently characterize the status of ambient water quality in a country. Therefore, countries select river, lake and groundwater     bodies that are representative and significant for the assessment and management of water quality to monitor and report on indicator     6.3.2. The quality status of individual water bodies is classified based on the compliance of the available water quality monitoring     data for the core parameters with target values defined by the country.

The measure of trends in ex situ conserved materials provides an overall assessment of the extent to which we are managing to maintain and/or increase the total genetic diversity available for future use and thus protected from any permanent loss of genetic diversity which may occur in the natural habitat, i.e. in situ, or on-farm.

Aggregate household consumption is computed as the sum of expenditure on food as well as value of auto consumption, expenditure on non-food, health items, education, housing utilities, value of in-kind wages, other benefits received by the household and a measure of the use value of durable goods owned by the household. Consumption per capita is then computed as the total consumption per adult equivalent. Where adult equivalence is an aggregate indicator for household size which takes into account its age and sex composition. The poverty line is then set with reference to a minimum food consumption basket, judged to offer the required number of calories (2200 k calories per day) for a Rwandan likely to be involved in physically demanding agricultural activity, along with an allowance for non-food consumption.
