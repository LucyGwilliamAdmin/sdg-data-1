indicator_definition: >-
  The probability of a child born in a specific year or period dying before
  reaching the age of 5 years, if subject to age specific mortality rates of
  that period, expressed per 1000 live births. The under-five mortality rate as
  defined here is, strictly speaking, not a rate (i.e. the number of deaths
  divided by the number of population at risk during a certain period of time)
  but a probability of death derived from a life table and expressed as a rate
  per 1000 live births.

target: >-
  By 2030, end preventable deaths of newborns and children under 5 years of age,
  with all countries aiming to reduce neonatal mortality to at least as low as
  12 per 1,000 live births and under-5 mortality to at least as low as 25 per
  1,000 live births

computation_definitions: >-
  Infant mortality rate is the probability (expressed as a rate per 1000 live
  births) of a child born alive in a specified period dying before reaching the
  age of one. The time reference of IMR is not the year in which the survey is
  undertaken; rather it is the five years period preceding the survey date.
  Hence, if an exact time point is needed as a time reference, it must be taken
  as the mid of the five-year interval preceding the survey date. A live birth
  is the complete expulsion or extraction from its mother of a product of
  conception, irrespective of the duration of the pregnancy, which, after such
  separation, breathes or shows any other evidence of life-such as beating of
  the heart, pulsation of the umbilical cord, or definite movement of voluntary
  muscles-whether or not the umbilical cord has been cut or the placenta is
  attached. Each product of such a birth is considered a live birth.
computation_calculations: >-
  IMR is derived from DHS data using the direct method. The direct method uses
  data collected on birth histories of women of childbearing age and produces
  the probability of dying before age one for children born alive, among women
  of childbearing age, during five year periods before the survey. Direct method
  require each child's date of birth, survival status, and age of the child on
  the date of the interview if alive and if not alive the age at death of each
  live births.
