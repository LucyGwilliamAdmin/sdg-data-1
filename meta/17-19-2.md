**Non-statistical indicator**

Since the 1970s, four modern population and housing censuses have been conducted in Rwanda, in 1978, 1991, 2002 and 2012.

The UN recommends carrying out a census at least every 10 years in it's [Principles and Recommendations for Population and Housing Censuses guidelines](https://unstats.un.org/unsd/demographic/meetings/egm/NewYork/2014/P&R_Revision3.pdf). Rwanda has committed to conduct the Population and Housing Census every ten years and the next census is expected in August 2022. Based on this commitment, the National Institute of Statistics of Rwanda has started the preparations for the fifth population and housing census.
